# parkinsons_data_mining

The intended goal of this dataset is to predict the status variable, which is a 0/1 indicator variable that describes if a patient has Parkinsonâ€™s based on attributes of speech 
patterns. 

Objectives:

A) Supervised Learning

  Pruned Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Decision tree models are used to predict the 'status' response.
  
  Select the optimal pruning parameter by cross-validation. Learn and visualize a pruned decision tree to predict status.
  
  Assess the performance of trained models with ROC plot and commenting on the degree of overfitting.
  
  To plot most important variable using random forest and gradient boosting models and analyze their effect on the model results with one parital dependence plot.

B) Unsupervised Learning 

  Learn K-Means and GMM clustering with optimal number of clusters from the dataset.
  
  Use chi-square distribution test to analyze the dependence of cluster membership and parkinson's status.
